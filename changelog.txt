$size[20]{$u{CHANGE LOG:}}

$size[14]{$u{Update for 08.11.2024 (Taipion):}}

  Right-Clicking several tools like the loom
  or crucible will now automatically bring
  up corresponding recipes, partly determined
  by what items you have in your inventory.
  
  Example: clicking a crucible with 5 or more
  silicate will bring up the glass recipe,
  with 25 or more golden eggs the gold bar recipe,
  otherwise the golden egg recipe.
  
  Use console command ":roc" to toggle on/off
  
  Leantos are now darker on the minimap if unclaimed
  and using a shape instead of an icon for them.
  
  Also: claimed leantos have the colour that you
  chose for blooming thornbushes,
  to toggle this on/off use console command ":hcl".
  
  
$size[14]{$u{Update for 22.09.2024 (Taipion):}}

  Right-Clicking any building that has a door will now
  click the door instead (to enter it)
  (only if CTRL/ALT/SHFT are not held)
  
  Right-Clicking anywhere on the ground will now
  be as if you used SmartSpace from the cursors
  location, thereby clicking the object closest
  to your cursor instead
  (only if CTRL/ALT/SHFT are not held)
  (only if not carrying something over your head)
  Note: toggle this on/off with console command "soc"
  
  Changed "show content icons" to be on by default

$size[14]{$u{Update for 16.03.2024 (Taipion):}}

  Fixed SmartSpace for horses
  
  Added ":belt ..." command to access your action bars,
  whereas ... is the number of the button, 
  use ":debug" to find out the first argument/number,
  then use the custom hotkeys to map it as you like
  
  Fixed makeshift scarecrow radius
  
  Fixed TimSort exception in rendering
  
  Fixed CTRL+L and CTRL+SHIFT+L to work the same
  as CTRL+F and CTRL+SHIFT+F
  
  You will now hear a sound if a blooming thornbush is nearby,
  you can toggle it on/off with ":tbalert"
  
  You can now change the colour of highlighting for blooming
  thornbushes to any colour you want, to do so, us the
  command ":tbcolour r g b" whereas rgb are values
  form 0 to 255 each
  
  Added the Stonetower to "auto doors"
  
  Updated the "list of hotkeys" in the xtended menu
  
  merged from vanilla client:
   - Implement basic support for store credit.
   - Display store credit.
   - Destroy store-window instead of hiding it.


$size[14]{$u{Update for 02.03.2024 (Taipion):}}

  - store button fix
  - height map improvement

$size[14]{$u{Update for 29.02.2024 (Taipion):}}
  
  Merged code from the default client
  for new server compatibility

  NPE fix in equipment hotswap feature



$size[14]{$u{Update for 03.02.2024 (Taipion):}}
  
  Fixed bug in season change log notification
  
  Fixed some recipe/food group in craving tooltip
  
  Fixed "purse protection" not working in or near deep water
  
  New Feature: "Eat All", use SHIFT-Right-Click on
  any food item that has uses to get this extra option!
  (when in progress, cancelled by "any mouse click" or WASD)
  
  New feature: npc/mannequin-colouring
  these now have a colour separate from actual players,
  both unknown and kin,
  use the console command like ":npcrgb 30 30 150" to set
  a new colour, with 3 numbers according to the rgb,
  or without any numbers to reset to default.
    
  Also: npc/mannequin are now set to to display below
  actual players on the minimap
  (order = 99, vs order = 100 for players)
  (you can set order in the radar.xml for all other things)
  (just add order="100" or whatever number you prefer)
  (next to name and show for the group)
  
  
$size[14]{$u{Update for 15.07.2023 (Taipion):}}
  
  Fixed crash with FlatnessTool upon logging out when active
  
  Fixed bug with ":inv all" not working properly
  
  Fixed bug with season-change-popup not showing up properly 
  upon login, if the season changed since the last login
  
  Fixed bug in craving tooltip,
  that would sometimes not display the food group
  
  Extended Feature: animal-stats-output
  use :animaloutput followed by 6 numbers, 1 or 0
  separated by space to set which stats you want
  to show, so animaloutput 0 0 0 1 1 1 would show
  only the last 3 stats in sum.
  (-50 per stat to keep the number small)
  (+/- the total offset you set with animaloutput
  followed by just one number)
   
  
$size[14]{$u{Update for 15.07.2023 (Taipion):}}
  
  Added new "static"-mode to the FlatnessTool!
  use CTRL+SHIFT+F/L or the new button to activate,
  if in static-mode, CTRL+SHIFT+F/L will close the tool!
  use ":flatgridsize 40" to change its range to 40 (or any number) 
  
  Added "new" ESCape-menu, hit ESC to access it
  
  Merged the new cert-stuff from the vanilla client
  
$size[14]{$u{Update for 04.06.2023 (Taipion):}}
  
  Added animal name to animal-stats-output-feature
  
  Added command ":ttoff" to toggle turn off ALL tooltips
  
  Fixed crash on closing the crafting window 
  
$size[14]{$u{Update for 27.05.2023 (Taipion):}}
  
  Added Food Groups to craving tooltip
  
  Fixed some items on the Cravings List (when you click the craving)
  
  crafting item link fix:
   fixed all broken item links when crafting, and clicking on items
   that are shown as ingredients
  
  craft window fix for "last craft"-button
   the button that brings you to the previously used crafting recipe
   will now always work (used to be broken for everything where the
   crafting result is an unfinished item, like almost all items
   in the bread food group)
  
  built-in-fuel-filler: fixed
   fixed an annoying little bug in the built-in-fuel-filler (CTRL+click),
   where it would just not work if you activated it in quick succession
  
  merged: z offsets (update to the vanilla client) 
  
$size[14]{$u{Update for 12.04.2023 (Taipion):}}
 
  Added a feature to give you the recipe of the craving
    (if there is a recipe) by clicking on it. 
  
  Added protection for your purse, you can from now on, not drop your purse
    when on water, that is, if you CTRL + click your purse when on water,
    it will give a message and not drop it,
    but you can still manually take and drop it.
 
  Fixed the shortcut CTRL+G not closing pumpkin packs.
  Also added pumpkin packs to sort windows list, auto-bucket-from-backpack,
    backpack-lock and all that. (Including "Big Autumn")
  
  Fixed cabbage & kale wine having no icon.
  
  Changed command line to ignore additional ":" so there is no confusion
    anymore, like when using custom hotkeys, so you can input commands
    in the hotkey window with ":" or without and it will all just work.
  
  Fixed a bug in the [ignored]-feature that allowed an ignored char
    to open a chat window with you through using the highlight feature.
  Additionally, the [ignored]-feature will now also prevent ignored chars
    chat from appearing in area chat, or any chat at all,
    though you will still see the chat bubbles.
  
  Note: If there is anything in chat you don't want to see, you can also simply
    right-click the chat, and everything in that chat will be deleted,
    this works for all chats including System and Log chats.
  
  Added animal numbers handling, with ":animaloutput" to toggle, and
    ":animaloutput x", where x is any number as offset, also negative,
    like ":animaloutput -35", this will output a number to LogChat that
    is the sum of all animal stats except the first, all minus 50 by default,
    so an animal with all 50 stats would output 0.
  Output is done when opening the stats window of an animal.
  
  Fixed a bug where the Screenshooter function would open 2 windows
    upon hitting ALT+S, though probably no one ever noticed
  
  Fixed crash with ":inv one" / ":inv all" if you'd inv something that moved.
  
  Added an output to ALT+LMB on sacks/bags/baskets where it tells you how
    many items are there in total (takes a few seconds).
    You know you can access a bunch of sacks/bags/baskets in a container,
    like a shed full of sacks, by ALT+clicking one of the sacks:
    - ALT+LMB opens all but closes the non-empty (and tells you the item # now)
    - ALT+MMB opens a window where you can input the # of items you want
    - ALT+RMB opens all
  


$size[14]{$u{Update for 27.08.2022 (Taipion):}}


  Abacus only re-positions itself to be in the visible area upon 
  (re-)opening it, instead of at every item change.
  
  Added System/Log-Chat notification of Exploration Event music playing
  
  Improved performance of the Abacus, saving you a few ms any time
  you move a lot of items, every little thing helps :-)
  
  Added icons for most fluids including wine,
  and a custom icon for milk (thanks to Vesemir!)
  Thanks to Mirrodin for the json list of icons and the idea!
  
  Added caching of all icons, which was especially noticeable
  on sheds full of seedbags, or any occasion with a lot of icons,
  the performance impact of icons was pretty huge, and is now near zero  
    
  Reduced the "Loading"-time upon entering an area (thx to Wintermute!)
  whereas it might look strange for a second,
  but you'll be able to see and act a little faster
  
  Added a lock to the backpack(s), so you can fix them in place
  without accidentally moving it
  
  Moved the buttons for item sorting, who knew there was a title bar?!
  Moved them a bit away from the close button, it should in general
  look better now and you can finally read what the container name is 
  
  Changed transfer limit from 72 items (cupboard)
  to 100 to account for nailboxes
    
  Added CandyBasket, NailBox and GemBox to the containers for
  ALT+RMB and ALT+LMB special "open all/not-empty sacks"-function 
  
  Excluded gems carats from picky alt comparison,
  excluded fishs weight from picky alt comparison,
  this means you can shift+alt+click transfer them all,
  without the need to deactivate the picky-alt-modifier
  
  Added a command line for SmartSpace -> ":space" 
  this way you can bind it to anything as custom hotkey
  
  Pluck before Butcher (for Hydrukies)
  
  Autoshovel will now only try to find a better shovel once,
  or if your equipped hand-slot-item changed, and not all the time
  
  Fixed FuelFiller plugin which would only do 1 item on rare  
  occasions when clicking fast between different targets
  
  New button: "Take ALL and close" ...well there is no new button,
  it is the "X" button, just hold SHIFT and click it,
  and you will "take all and close" instead of just close,
  there is also a tooltip saying that, which can be turned off
  in Options/Inventory&Items
  
  NEW function/window: Take X from Sacks (...baskets, boxes),  
  simply hold ALT and click with middle mouse button on a sack
  (or basket, or box) and a window will open, enter an amount
  and that amount will be automatically taken form the sack you
  clicked and all others (if there are any) in that container,
  so... got a shed full of shrooms and want to take out 1000 shrooms?
  -> just ALT+MMB one sack, enter amount, watch and enjoy!
  
  NEW item-scroll functions, hold CTRL and mousewheel-scroll items  
  in and out of containers,
  #1: CTRL + scroll-out takes items by position (bottom right to top left)
  instead of the order the server determines, easy taking out
  bad humus and worms among other things
  #2: CTRL + scroll-in will take items from your inventory into the
  container, taking those items first that are the fewest in your inv,
  beware this targets containers by the order you opened them, there
  is unfortunately no other way, just don't open more than one container
  when using this
  
  The .res files for the icons are now directly in the client jar,
  which means icons should always work, regardless of if the player has
  already seen the items/stuff where the icons are taken from, also means
  a tiny bit less .res downloading on new/cleaned-up client installations 
  
  Background music on multiple clients:
  Now, if you have music on, and more than one client running,
  only the last active instance will play music, and all other instances
  will be automatically muted, this way there is no overlapping music,
  and you can finally turn music volume on and enjoy Salems tunes,
  even if you use more than one client instance at once!
  
  

$size[14]{$u{Update for 14.02.2022 (Taipion):}}

  Fixed that hidden UI elements were still click-able (=blocking clicks)
  
  Set "Gather Lard" (if set in auto-chose) to always have priority over all
  else, after that, priority (if set in auto-chose) is "Skin" (unchanged) 
  
  Fixed Abacus-Window positioning, it will "jump" back into the visible
  area upon toggling it on/off, just like the inventory does.
  
  Added the new stoves as targets for the built-in FuelFillerPlugin,
  use as usual with CTRL+click with item in hand
  
  Took over new "drop all" functionality CTRL+ALT+click, works like before,
  but uses server sided function to do it in one command, not 1 per item, 
  should remove any lagg from dropping large amounts of items,
  and it should be faster, too
  
  For now, I did not take over the new "transfer all",
  because it has no sorting o.o
  
  Re-Added the "old" NightVision mode, to switch between old and new,
  just use CTRL+SHIFT+N, and then CTRL+N as usual
  
  Added System-Chat output to "old" NightVision mode,
  so you always know what you just selected
  
  The "old" NightVision mode is now properly persisted between sessions,
  this includes the angle, so you set it once and that's it
  (the angle was not persisted in previous clients like latikais)
  
  Added a Link to the official Discord on the Login-Screen,
  you can turn it off in Options/General if it bothers you ;)
  but you should really go there, it's where all the fun is!
  
  Cleaned up some misalignment in Options/Camera & Graphics 
  
  Added an Option under Options/General to always display
  the Patch Notes, not only once after an update
  
  
$size[14]{$u{Update for 23.12.2021 (Taipion):}}

  Complete rework of the "Nightvision" feature: CTRL+N (!)
  It will now illuminate ALL wall faces in mines!
  There are 7 levels of brightness, use CTRL+N to cycle through 1-7 and off,
  also the client will tell you the current setting with every use of CTRL+N
  
  Added "Nightvision" to the "outside world" as separate setting!
  The client will know if you are "inside a mine" or "outside of a mine",
  and CTRL+N will set and save settings for "in" and "out" separately,
  so you can live in darkness, but with light!
  And have a separate setting for mines at the same time!
  
  Note: Saved settings for Nightvision for "in" and "out" are 
  usually applied upon loading/entering an area,
  if not it will be applied after walking a few tiles.
  
  Added ":placegrid x" command line option for further evaluation,
  x is a number that changes sub-tile precision when placing things with CTRL.
  
  Fixed bug with getting KOed and the death/KO-animation fix,
  which was effecting the "stars over the head" animation.
  
  

$size[14]{$u{Update for 03.12.2021 (Taipion):}}

  Fixed a bug with the new performance-saver on dead animal animations
  and render distance, if you used render distance limit it would
  still play the death animation.
  
  Fixed auto-door not working on makeshift gates that had grapes nearby
  
  Fixed a little bug that prevented ALT+SHIFT+click transfer on sacks
  
  Fixed a few bugs with the new Hotkeys, specifically editing existing
  Hotkeys and the use of ALT as modifier
  
  Upgrade: The "death animation fix" now also applies to player characters,
  so you won't see the KO-animation on them if not appropriate.
  
  New Feature: Offset from "snap to grid" when placing ghost objects,
  use ":offset x y" with x and y being numbers 0 to 10,
  this setting is not saved between client restarts,
  Note: not recommended when placing walls
  
  Hotfix: This client version has a fix for the "Makeshift-Gate-Crash"
  that was introduced with the Game-Update on 03.12.2021
  

$size[14]{$u{Update for 17.11.2021 (Taipion):}}
	
  Fixed a bug in the auto-equip-shovel functionality,
  that is used when destroying stumps.
  It should be much more reliable now.
  
  Changed SmartSpace so it will target grapes on makeshift fence instead of the fence, if applicable.
  
  Fixed ":inv" to never make the player char invisible in this way, as that'd crash the client,
  use ":p" instead to toggle player visibility safely.
  
  Fixed Signs (the sign you can build and write text on) crash on more than 2340 characters.
  Input is now simply limited to that number.
  Note that the maximum number of characters allowed to actually put on a sign is only like 150.
  
  ALT+Click which transfers "only same items with the exact same %" now works regardless
  of "picky alt" being selected or not.
  
  The sound you can set for the buff-alert was not properly persisted (saved),
  now it is. :-)
  
  By default, and not optional, the animation processing of dead animals (and dead deers and bears)
  is removed, after they played their death animation upon loading,
  you won't see any difference, but your fps may be seriously better now
  if there are a lot of dead animals around.
  Note: that you can still use "remove all animation" in Options/General to do just that for everything.
  
  Added Undertake Shovel to the auto-equip-shovel-function for when you destroy a stump	
  
  Fixed a bug with "toggle mute all audio / CTRL+9" when using multiple client windows	
  
  Fixed the "Smoke Lagg" for cementation furnances, reducing the smokes heavy performance impact
  by somewhat like 90%, it should be much less bad now
  
  Fixed a bug with SmartSpace and "remove all animations"-option and mounts,
  it does not crash anymore, but due to how it works, SmartSpace will be pretty useless while mounted,
  if and only if you also use "remove all animations" at the same time
  
  Added new feature "ALT+leftClick on Sacks", like "ALT+rightClick on Sacks", just that it only opens
  sacks which have items in them (closes the others), also works with egg baskets ofc
  
  Added functionality to the command ":x" (if used with no parameters) it will open the xtended menu
  from anywhere, but also tab through the pages of the xtended menu if you have several pages, like
  if you use a lot of plugins
  
  Hotkeys!!! did a whole big rework on them, see patch notes on the forums for details!
  



$size[14]{$u{Update for 22.08.2021 (Taipion):}}
	
  Added separate cam control inversion option for left/right (x),
  next to the option for up/down (y) from the previous patch



$size[14]{$u{Update for 20.08.2021 (Taipion):}}

  Food troughs now have a radius with ALT+R
  
  New Option to invert the mouse cam controls
  Options/Camera & Graphics/invert mouse cam
  This applies to the following cams:  
  Free Cam (:cam free)
  Smooth Free Cam (:cam sucky)
  Far Out Cam (:cam farout)
  
  Fixed the "sort only main inventory"-option for continuous sorting,
  it was not properly persisted (saved) between client restarts.
  (no one used it?! had not a single person complain about it -.-)
  


$size[14]{$u{Update for 03.08.2021 (Taipion):}}

  Added console command to hide the whole UI or parts of it,
  should come in handy for making videos or less revealing screenshots,
  type in ":h help" to find out how it works
  
  In combo to that, added console command ":p" to (un)hide the player  
  model, too
  
  Added a new, entertaining way to look through what your char
  has, can, and much more:
  console command ":x show ..." will look for ... and show 
  all skills, actions, attacks, building, recipes, plugins,...
  then ":x ..." will call ... directly,
  also just using ":x" will call the xtended menu, as there
  is otherwise no way to make a shortcut to it,
  try playing around with this in combo with the hotkeys feature
  (gonna rework hotkeys in a coming patch!)
  
  Fixed a rare bug with the auto-equip-shovel,
  it should be even more reliable now
  
  => as always, look at the forum thread for more details to this patch!
  
  

$size[14]{$u{Update for 20.05.2021 (Taipion):}}

  Quick fix for some weird outputs to the Log-Chat
  that came with the last update

 ... previous patch notes from Latikai:
 
$size[14]{$u{Update for 31.12.15 (Latikai):}}
  * Included scarecrows for the radius display. Might require a fix for scarecrows in other seasons, but I hope not.
  * Added a button that lets you choose which server you connect to for authenticating. This is be remembered over client restarts, and should allow popham players to connect even though providence is down.
  * The client will now state which type of object is highlighted when you (or someone else) alt-clicks an object in the world. Particularily handy for knowing which fruit tree is flowering.
  * The wiki was now changed to salemwiki.info again. May require you to empty out ~/Salem/cache.

$size[14]{$u{Update for 07.11.15 (Latikai):}}
  * Fixed crash for inventory sorting with stuff on fishing rods.
  * New default radar.xml (will not replace your old settings until you delete ~/Salem/radar.xml)

  * Auto-sifting is now in! For now, this is completely automatic until I get enough complaints that it should be made an option.

  * An additional sort button to sort by highest gluttony value rather than names/purity. Similar as the auto-sifting: as a separate button until I get enough complaints that it should be made an option.
